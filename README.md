# The-Simple-CRUD

Weolcome to SimpleCRUD!

This serves as a sample implementation of a full-stack application that consist of three parts: a web application, a backend REST API and a persistence/storage in this case as in-memory database. It demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation on the entity/model. It also demonstrates the one-to-one relationship between two entities (Customer - Address, Office - Address) and many-to-many relationship of entities (Customer <-> Office) using JPA/Hibernate framework.

First part is a web application using these technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. NodeJS
4. Angular 8
5. Bootstrap 4

Please search the internet to download, install and/or configure NodeJS, Bootstrap 4 and Angular 8.
You can use any text editor of your choice but I preferably use Visual Studio Code in developing the web application.  Once installed, you can test the application thru a browser or other means where you can initiate HTTP calls.

Second (and third part) is/are based on the following technologies and implemented as REST API (microService):
1. Java 8
2. Spring framework
3. Spring Boot
4. JPA/Data API
5. Hibernate

Please search the internet to download, install and/or configure Java.  The rest are dependencies included in the POM file of the API.
You can use Java-based IDEs for development but I used Spring Tool Suite (STS) 4 for this development.  

I plan to deploy a live demo of the application in a public cloud and will update this repo as soon as I have the link to the application.

This Simple-CRUD will be updated as well with newer techniques and/or probably updates from the technologies used in this application.

Happy coding!
